\chapter{Device Tree Requirements}

This project requires only three GPIOs.  Rather than editing device tree files, 
and having to deal with potential bugs caused by this, the great config-pin 
utility was used.  This utility is provided by the Universal IO project.

The Universal IO project is located at this Github repository:

\url{https://github.com/cdsteinkuehler/beaglebone-universal-io}

Universal IO is included with the most recent Debian-based IOT images.
