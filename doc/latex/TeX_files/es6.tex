\chapter{Ecmascript 6}

This page shows which Ecmascript 6 features are implemented in major versions
of Node:

Javascript has become a feature rich and large language!
Some of the ES6 constructs used in this project:

\begin{itemize}
\item class
\item Map
\item Proxy
\item const and let
\end{itemize}

A good reference for ES6 is at the Mozilla Developer Network:

\url{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript}

A quick summary of the ES6 constructs follows.

\subsection{class}

The new ``class'' keyword does not provide new functionality.  What is does is 
allow a Javascript class object to be written in a more traditional 
object-oriented style.  This does make things easier for a person used to other 
language's syntax for defining classes.

\subsection{Map}

The ``Map'' is a new data structure object which is similar to what is called a 
``hash'', dictionary, or associative array.  Prior to ES6, the Javascript 
object was used functionally as a Map, however, this was kind of a hack.

In this project, the Map object is used in the pumpActuator object.

\subsection{Proxy}

Of the above ES6 constructs, the only one requiring detailed explanation is the 
``Proxy''.  The construct is used to implement the so-call ``Observer'' pattern.

Here is the code:
