\chapter{Setting the BBGW to Local Time}

The default time setting of the BBGW was found to be UTC.  It was desired to 
have this set to local time.

Fortunately, there is a web page by Derek Molloy which covers this subject in 
detail:

\url{http://derekmolloy.ie/automatically-setting-the-beaglebone-black-time-using-ntp/}

The change to local time is done by removing an existing file, and then adding 
a symbolic link:

\begin{verbatim}
cd /etc
rm localtime
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
\end{verbatim}

In the above example, the time zone is set to North America Eastern (New 
York).  A complete listing of the possibilities is found in/usr/share/zoneinfo.
Simply find the appropriate path for your time zone and create the link.

The time zone setting will take effect upon the next boot.

Note that the BBGW does not have a local clock source.  It obtains timing data 
via the ``Network Time Protocol''.  It must have internet access for this to 
function.
