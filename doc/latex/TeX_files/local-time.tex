\chapter{Setting the BBGW to Local Time}

The default time setting of the BBGW was found to be UTC.  It was desired to 
have this set to local time.

Fortunately, there is a web page by Derek Molloy which covers this subject in 
detail:

CHECK IF DEFAULT IMAGE HAS ACTIVE NTP

The change to local time is done by removing an existing file, and then adding 
a symbolic link:

\begin{verbatim}
cd /etc
rm localtime
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime
\end{verbatim}

In the above example, the time zone is set to North America Eastern (New 
York).  A complete listing of the possibilities is found in/usr/share/zoneinfo.
Simply find the appropriate path for your time zone and create the link.

The time zone setting will take effect upon the next boot.
