\chapter{Running the Project}

The project must be cloned to the BBGW and the NPM modules installed.

After ssh into the BBGW, typically you will be in directory /home/debian.
From there, enter these commands:

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/Greg-R/irrigate-control.git
cd irrigate-control
cd software/node
npm install --save
\end{verbatim}

The project will be pulled from the git repository.  The node modules need to 
be installed in the directory from which the server will be launched.
The above should install the modules into a directory ``node\_modules''.

Now it is time to run the server!

\begin{verbatim}
sudo node server.js
\end{verbatim}

If all goes well, the command line should look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
WebSocket server started...
Server is running at port 8089.
\end{verbatim}
