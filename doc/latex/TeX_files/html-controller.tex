\chapter{An HTML5 Controller}

The controller GUI is an HTML5 web page.  The project was developed with the 
Chromium browser in Ubuntu 16.04.

There was no attempt to fix problems with cross-browser compatibility issues.  
plain HTML5 and CSS was used throughout.  This is a bare-bones interface with 
no fancy features.
