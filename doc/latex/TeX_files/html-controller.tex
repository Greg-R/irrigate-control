\chapter{An HTML5 Controller}

The controller GUI is an HTML5 web page.  The project was developed with the 
Chromium browser in Ubuntu 16.04.

There was no attempt to fix problems with cross-browser compatibility issues.  
Plain HTML5 and CSS was used throughout.  The HTML was manipulated directly via 
the ``Document Object Model'' (DOM) technology in the web browser.  This is a 
bare-bones interface with no fancy features.

Manual control buttons for the zone solenoids and the pump motor are at the 
top.  The user can enter a schedule date and start and stop times.  Clicking 
the ``Schedule'' button sends the requested irrigation schedule to the server.  
The server responds with a message which updates the displayed schedule.  No 
rigorous checking of inputs is done.

The current date and time  are shown in the last line of the controller page.
